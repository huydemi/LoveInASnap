# LoveInASnap

In this tutorial, you’ll use OCR to woo your true heart’s desire. 

You’ll create an app called Love In A Snap using Tesseract, an open-source OCR engine maintained by Google. 

With Love In A Snap, you can take a picture of a love poem and “make it your own” by replacing the name of the original poet’s muse with the object of your affection. Brilliant! Get ready to impress.
